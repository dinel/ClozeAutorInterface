                    <h2>The title of this study is: What are the reading difficulties 
                        of people who have autism?</h2>
                    
                    <p>My name is Victoria Yaneva and I am a researcher at the 
                        University of Wolverhampton. My research is in the area 
                        of Psycholinguistics. The name of my line manager is 
                        Professor Ruslan Mitkov. </p>
                    
                    <p>I would like to invite you to take part in a research study. 
                        First, I am going to explain to you what this study is about.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why am I doing this study:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research has found that sometimes people who have 
                            autism may find reading difficult.
                        <li>Because of these difficulties with reading, people 
                            with autism have difficulties at school and limited 
                            access to important educational material, documents 
                            and news. 
                        <li>The aim of this study is to understand whether certain 
                            computer programs can help people with autism read better. 
                        <li>This is an important thing to know, because it will 
                            make it easier for students with autism to have good 
                            marks at school or at university and to understand 
                            written information better.
                        <li>The results from this study will be published in a 
                            scientific article. A scientific article is a text, 
                            which describes how a study has been done and what 
                            the results from it are. I will not mention anyoneâ€™s 
                            name in the article. This means that no one will know 
                            that you have participated in a study or  what answers 
                            you gave to the questions in the study.
                    </ul></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What would you have to do if you decided to participate?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I will ask you to read short texts and fill in a few gaps 
                            (missing words) in the texts. You will be able to see 
                            the missing words on the right side of the text and 
                            choose which one to put in each gap.
                        <li>While you are answering the questions about the texts, 
                            the computer will measure the time it takes you to 
                            give an answer. It is okay to take as much time as you need.
                        <li>I oblige not to tell anyone your name, nor to show 
                            them any of the answers. I oblige to keep all data in 
                            a safe place. Only my line manager and I will have access to your data.
                        <li>If you decide that you no longer want to participate 
                            in this study, you can stop at any point. 
                        <li>If after you finish the study you decide that you do not 
                            want me to use your data, you can let me know and I 
                            will not use them. You can contact me at v.yaneva@wlv.ac.uk. 
                            You can also contact my line manager at r.mitkov@wlv.ac.uk. 
                        <li>If you would like to learn more about the results of 
                            the study, you can write to me at v.yaneva@wlv.ac.uk.
