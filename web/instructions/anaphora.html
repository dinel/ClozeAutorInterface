You are doing fantastic!<br />
<br />
You will now see a text in which some words are in red. Below each red word there is a choice of three other words. Your task is to select the word that has the same meaning in the sentence as the word in red. Here is an example of how this looks like:<br />
<br />

<div class="voffset5" style="height: 100px; border: black thin solid; padding: 1em;">
<span>Mary has a doll with a blond hair and a blue dress.</span>
<div id="gap1" class="gap gap-position">She
    <div class="gap-fillers not-answered" id="words1">
                                                    <div id="word-1-1" class="filler filler-1">Mary</div>
                                                    <div id="word-1-2" class="filler filler-1">the doll</div>
                                                    <div id="word-1-3" class="filler filler-1">the hair</div>

    </div>                                    
</div>
<span>likes playing with it.</span>
</div>

<br />

<br />
2) Once you have completed the exercise, please press the &quot;next&quot; button shown below to proceed.<br />
<br />
3) You will then need to answer a question  about how easy or difficult you found the text. Press &quot;next&quot; after you have selected your answer.<br />
<br />
4) You will now be shown a list of reading comprehension questions that you have to answer. You can have a look at the text again by pressing the &quot;Show the text again&quot; button. You can have a look at the text as many times as you wish while answering the comprehension questions.<br />
<br />
